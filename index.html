About :
Hi, I'm Obsuliman! 
But you can call me Suli. 
I am a student at Code The Dream School. I have as a plan to reach all possible goals in this course in order to try to continue in the next courses. I would like to become a good developer one day, and be able to work in a good work environment and thus also be able to contribute to the developer community.
Experience :
My first steps in programming were through Free Code Camp, there I took the JavaScript course on algorithm and data structures. I have also acquired knowledge in online tutorials and sites like Khan Academy which have helped me understand more programming concepts contributing greatly to my experience.
