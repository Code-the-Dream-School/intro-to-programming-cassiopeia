About
My name is Shayla Harris, and I'm a lot of things right now! I'm a student all over again learning the ins and outs of web development, while working part time as a Media Analyst of a startup company. I'm in search of a new career opportunity that will align the skills I'm learning with the customer service skills I possess at this time.
