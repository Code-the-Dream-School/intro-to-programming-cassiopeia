<h1>Estevan Carrillo</h1>
<h2>About:</h2>
<p>Hello, as you know, my name is Estevan but I also go by Esty as it is easier for people to pronounce.
    Despite being in Code the Dream, I am very new to the world of coding. I began my career as an educator
    and shifted careers this year (2022). I currently work as an administrative assistant for a health
    company where I focus more on developing projects, overseeing online data, etc. Joining CtD was meant
    to refocus on what I initially began studying as a college student, and I hope to take advantage of this
    opportunity so I can eventually work for a strong tech company, preferably a gaming company.</p>
 
<h2>Experience:</h2>
<ul><li>Pre-College Experience
    - Jumpoline Park, Cashier</li>   
 
<li>College Experience
    - University of Cincinnati Alumni Center, Student Worker
    - University of Cincinnati REC Center, Camp Counselor and Referee</li>
 
<li>Teaching Experience
    - Minnesota Math and Science Academy, 5th Grade Math Teacher
    - Robbinsdale Middle School, 6th-8th Grade Math Teacher</li>
 
<li>Post Teaching Experience
    - Panacea Healthcare Solutions LLC</li></ul>
 
<p>As I previously mentioned, I am new to coding so I do not have any coding experience outside of the class.
    My current job provides avenues to getting coding experience, but I am currently doing different work for
    the company. This work involves communicating with people/companies interestedin our products, seeking
    employment verification, renewing subscriptions, etc. From the technology side, I am often formatting
    documents to meet our requirements, transferring data from one source to another, crafting digital project
    plans, and hosting webinars.</p>
 
<p>That being said, I do not have experience with any coding projects outside of those we have previously worked
    on in Cassiopeia. A year from now, I hope to have developed a significant boost in my relevant experience.</p>
