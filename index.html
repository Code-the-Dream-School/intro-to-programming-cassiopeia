About
Hi there,
Thanks for visiting my Personal Portfolio!
My name is Marwa. I’m an international grad. Student from Lebanon. I’m currently enrolled at San Francisco State University’s Instructional Technologies prog.
They teach us about UI/UX design among other skills related to Tech. and the different teaching theories for multiple learning styles.
But I’m also learning Web. Development on the side through Code The Dream. 
I’d like to intern as a front-end developer or UX designer to practice my learning.
If you think you can help me with that, I’d really appreciate it! Thank you so much in advance!
