            <p>Hello my name is Veronica Johnson. Hmmm a little bit about me. Well, I'm a Mom of two amazing young men.
                They are pretty opposite as it pertains to almost everything. The one thing they have in common, I would
                have to say is that they both have great hearts and they are both super creative. As for me, aprt from
                the fact that I am absolutely fascinated by technology, I'm a true creative at my core,.</p>
